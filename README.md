# Automated Colorization of Grayscale Images

This project implements an automated system for colorizing grayscale images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and deep learning techniques. The system uses the Caffe framework, OpenCV for image processing, and CNNs for the colorization process. The goal of the project is to transform black-and-white images into their colorized counterparts, enhancing the image's aesthetic and information value.

## Project Overview

The core of the project involves using a deep learning model trained on a dataset of color images to predict and apply color to grayscale images. The colorization process is performed by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which learns to map grayscale pixel values to their corresponding color values.

## Technologies Used
- **Caffe**: Deep learning framework used for training the CNN model.
- **OpenCV**: Library for image processing and manipulation.
- **Python**: Programming language for implementing the model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualization and displaying results.

## Features
- Converts grayscale images to realistic color images.
- Utilizes CNNs to predict the correct color for each pixel.
- Image preprocessing and postprocessing using OpenCV for optimal results.
- Ability to process large datasets for training and real-time colorization.

## Live Demo

You can **test the live demo** of the colorization system hosted on [AWS EC2](http://51.20.253.214:5000/) by uploading grayscale images for real-time colorization.
